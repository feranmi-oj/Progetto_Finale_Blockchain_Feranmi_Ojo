  <p>START2LIMITED_SHOES_EDITION is a platform to manage the sale of limited edition shoes through a charity auction.
    Each auction has a certain duration, and users of the platform can place any amount on any auction still in progress.
    the platform uses two databases: it uses Redis as the main database.
    In fact, if the platform in the future can generate a lot of attention and be used by an ever-increasing number of users who may require having to scale horizontally to handle the traffic, it needs a very fast database to manage the various bets, to then store the outcome of the auction,
    like all other user data, on a relational database.</p>
